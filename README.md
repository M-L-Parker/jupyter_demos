### pivoting_test
A quick demonstration for the probable origin of the unexplained higher order component in Parker+15. This is due to pivoting of the powerlaw, which cannot be properly approximated by a linear function.

### red_noise_periodograms
Test of the effect of bootstrapping a red-noise lightcurve to detect significant periods in the periodogram. Includes concise demonstration of why this is wrong.
